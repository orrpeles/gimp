A few simple gimp features:
1.) Erase a line on PDF by going to ink tool, choosing white color and add a white layer over the black text making it disappear.
2.) Choose the 'A' (text box), to add a text box, straight and forward.
3.) Stretch canvas in case of multiple PDF pages. Image -> Canvas Size -> height
4.) Move the images to be one below the other (tools -> transform tools -> move)
5.) From layers menu choose merge layers
6.) From file choose override <path>

In case toolbox and layers widgets disappear, go to Window -> Toolbox and Window -> Layers respectively
